A social scientist has carried out an experiment on whether a given medical intervention is perceived as enhancement or as therapy. Each participant was randomly assigned to read one (and only one) vignette describing the use of a pill to enhance one of 12 cognitive, affective or social (CAS) domains. The vignettes described a situation in which an individual was using a pill to enhance the relevant domain under one of two possible enhancement conditions, one perceived as enhancing above the norm (EAN), what most people recognize as a clear case of enhancement, whereas the other perceived as enhancing towards the norm (ETN), with the individual using the enhancement having a modest, but subclinical deficit. Participants were asked how comfortable they were with the individual using the enhancement and about the impact the enhancement might have had in the individuals’ success in life.
The scientist has conducted thematic analysis on the participants’ responses, and come up with the following coding framework:
1	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - no specific reason given
2	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - changing something fundamental
3	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - changing the brain
4	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - side effect
5	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - general concerns about pills
6	Not comfortable with him taking the pill – no need, nor medically necessary
7	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - naturalistic moral concerns
8	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - risks outweight the benefits
9	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - dependence, addiction
10	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - social pressure to fit in
11	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - legal or prescribed
12	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - god or religious concerns
13	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - other: fairness, social issues, character
14	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - status quo : new pill
15	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - permanent changes (brain concern?)
16	Comfortable with him taking the pill - no specific reason
17	Comfortable with him taking the pill - not changing anything fundamental
18	Comfortable with him taking the pill - his choice
19	Comfortable with him taking the pill - minor or no side effects
20	Comfortable with him taking the pill - comfortable with pills and medication
21	Comfortable with him taking the pill - positive benefits
22	Comfortable with him taking the pill - nothing wrong with using science or other means to improve ourselves
23	Comfortable with him taking the pill - benefits outweight the risks
24	Comfortable with him taking the pill - consent/informed decision
25	Comfortable with him taking the pill - no pressure to take it
26	Comfortable with him taking the pill - legal or prescribed
27	Comfortable with him taking the pill - no harm to himself or others
28	Comfortable with him taking the pill - other specific reason
29	Other
