1,John didn't have a problem - he was just fine the way he was.

4,"John is healthy and is not suffering from any sort of problem. He is already sociable and it seems odd that he would seek to make himself even more sociable. I would be worried about side effects as well, though ultimately it is up to John to make decisions in his own life.","

10,"John is alrady comfortable with his amount of sociability before he has the option to take the medicine. For John, the medicine is unneccessary. The medicine seems better suited for those who need it, such as sufferers of Generalized Anxiety Disorder who could use the pill to solve a problem if their particular anxiety is a detrement to their life. It seems unethical for John to take the pill, whereas he has no need for it and the doctor has no right to prescribe it to him because he has no need.", 5	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - side effect; 4	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - changing brain; 5	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - side effect; 6	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - general concerns about pills; 7	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - naturalistic moral concerns; 8	Not comfortable of him taking the pill - risks outweight the benefits; 9	Not comfortable with him taking the pill - dependence; 10	Not

12,"While it is up to John whether or not to take it (since it's legal, apparently), I've always been anti-chemical or anti-drug for most ailments of the body.  I'm not for the effects of alcohol or even caffeine for that matter.  Just don't think it's a very natural thing to do to the body.","
